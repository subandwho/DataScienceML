# DataScienceML
This repository contains my work towards learning and building a Data Science and ML profile
The datasets are from kaggle and the code is inspired by medium/kaggle notebooks. I have tried my best and implemented these notebooks onto different
datasets and changed parameters. The idea here has been to get familiar with programming while understandibng the structure and docs
of various DS/ML related libraries.

The following are links/resources I find helpful and refer to and have been collected from youtube, linkedin and medium.
